# Python Telegram Chatbot with Hugging Face Integration

## Overview
This Python bot integrates with Telegram to provide responses from a Hugging Face model. The bot listens to messages and uses a text-generation model to generate replies.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Requirements**
   - Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Bot Token**
   - Create a bot in Telegram via BotFather and copy the token.
   - Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in the script with your bot's token.

3. **Run the Bot**
   - Execute the script: `python bot.py`.
   - Start chatting with your bot in Telegram.

## Adding Features
To add extra features:
- Modify the `chat` function to integrate additional models or logic.
- Use the Telegram Bot API for more complex interactions.
- Consider using webhooks instead of polling for scalability.
